# MTA-STS/TLS-RPT AWS Module

This repo contains a module for deploying an [MTS-STS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8461) and [TLS-RPT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8460) policy for a domin in AWS using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

This consists of using AWS API Gateway with a Custom Domain to host the MTA-STS policy, with a TLS certificate provided by AWS ACM. It uses Route53 to configure the DNS portions of both MTA-STS and TLS-RPT.

## How to use this Module

This module assumes AWS Account with access to Route53, API Gateway, and ACM.

It can be used in two modes:

1) If the domain onto which you wish to deploy MTA-STS/TLS-RPT is hosted in Route53 and this account has access:

```terraform
module "mtastspolicy_examplecom" {
  source          = "github.com/ukncsc/terraform-aws-mtasts"
  zone_id         = "Z00AAAAAAA0A0A"            // Optional - If not specified then it will run in mode 2
  domain          = "example.com"
  mx              = ["mail.example.com"]        // Optional - default looks up MX records for the domain in DNS 
  mode            = "testing"                   // Optional - default is testing
  reporting_email = "tlsreporting@example.com"  // Optional - default is no TLS-RPT entry
}

output "output" {
  value = module.mtastspolicy_examplecom.output
}
```

2) If the domain onto which you wish to deploy MTA-STS/TLS-RPT is hosted elsewhere and you would like to delegate to new zones in Route53:
   
```terraform
  module "mtastspolicy_examplecom" {
  source          = "github.com/ukncsc/terraform-aws-mtasts"
  domain          = "example.com"
  mx              = ["mail.example.com"]        // Optional - default looks up MX records for the domain in DNS 
  mode            = "testing"                   // Optional - default is testing
  reporting_email = "tlsreporting@example.com"  // Optional - default is no TLS-RPT entry or zone
  delegated = false                             // Optional - default is false. Change this to true once the new zones are delegated from your domain
}

output "output" {
  value = module.mtastspolicy_examplecom.output
}
```
When running in Mode 2, the zone delegation instructions are shown after a terraform apply in the Instructions output variable.
If you change delegated=true before following the instructions and fully delegating the DNS then terraform will fail.

Specifying MX is optional, if they are retrieved from DNS you MUST check your policy to ensure the correct values were populated.
